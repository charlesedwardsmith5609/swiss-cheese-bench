# Pairing mode: working agreements

A human engineer directs this work and owns every design decision: what to build, what to
accept, what to reject, and how to verify it. You implement scoped asks and keep your reasoning
visible so each decision can be reviewed before it lands.

## Rules

1. **Plan before code, and get it reviewed.**
   - Before the first plan, write the agreed requirements to `REQUIREMENTS.md` and ask the human
     to confirm them.
   - For each step, write the plan to `plans/step-N.md`: files touched, types, who owns any
     shared state, and the tests you will add.
   - Then run `bash scripts/plan-review.sh plans/step-N.md`. Present the plan's key points, each
     reviewer finding with your assessment (agree or disagree, with a reason), and wait for
     approval before writing code.
   - When the human approves with changes, update the plan file to match before implementing.
   - Exception: when the human says "scaffold", write boilerplate directly.
2. **Stay inside the approved step.** When the approved step is done, stop and report. Do not
   continue into later steps, even if they were mentioned. Do not add features that were not
   asked for; list them under "Suggestions" instead.
3. **No new dependencies without approval.** Each language section below lists what is already
   allowed. To propose anything else, name it and say what it replaces and why.
4. **Done means the check passes.** After every change, run `bash scripts/check.sh` and report
   the result per stage. A clean compile is not done. Never claim something builds or passes
   without running it.
5. **Behavioral tests.** Test through real interfaces (a real listener on `127.0.0.1` port 0,
   real HTTP requests, real DOM). Every wait in a test has a timeout so a broken test fails
   instead of hanging. No sleeps for synchronization.
6. **Name the ownership.** For any change that touches shared state, state which thread,
   goroutine, task or component owns it and how others reach it.
7. **Load the skills first.** Read the skill files listed in the relevant language section
   before writing code in that area.
8. **Ask, don't guess.** If a requirement is ambiguous, ask. If you must assume, put the
   assumption at the top of your reply.
9. **Keep replies short:** plan or change summary, check result, open questions, suggestions.
   Prefer lists over wide tables; the terminal may be narrow.

## Commands

| Purpose                                             | Command                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Validation gate (every language in this project)    | `bash scripts/check.sh`        |
| Plan review (after writing each plan)               | `bash scripts/plan-review.sh`  |
| Cross-model review (code, at milestones)            | `bash scripts/cross-review.sh` |

Both reviews send work to a different AI provider: the plan review checks a plan against
`REQUIREMENTS.md` before any code exists, and the cross-model review checks the code diff. A
review can take a few minutes, so run them with a 10-minute timeout. When
findings come back, give your assessment of each one (agree or disagree, with a reason) and do not
change the plan or the code until the human decides.

## This project

- `.`: python

### Python (`.`)

- Application code uses the standard library only. Dev tools already installed in `.venv`:
  pytest, ruff, mypy. Install nothing else without approval.
- Run tools through `.venv/bin/` (for example `.venv/bin/python`, `.venv/bin/pytest`).
- Type hints on every function; mypy must pass. Code lives in the `swiss_cheese_bench/` package, tests in `tests/`.
- Concurrency: say whether code is threaded or asyncio. Never block the event loop; name which
  thread or task owns shared state.
- Network tests use real sockets on `127.0.0.1` port 0, with a timeout on every read or wait.
- Skill: read `skills/python-service.md` before writing server code.
- Check stages: ruff check, ruff format --check, mypy, pytest.
